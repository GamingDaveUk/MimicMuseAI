# MimicMuseAI  
**An Open-Source C# AI Storytelling Companion**  

MimicMuseAI is an open-source C# application designed for AI-assisted story creation, with potential expansion to other AI-powered features. *Currently in active development.*
Note: I had AI help create this Readme to make it less bland.

## 🔍 FAQ

### ❓ Why the name "MimicMuseAI"?
Finding an available name for AI projects is *ridiculously hard*! After 3 hours of brainstorming:  
- **Mimic** = Adaptability  
- **Muse** = Creative Inspiration  
- **AI** = ...well, AI!  

It represents AI-driven adaptive inspiration. Plus, it was available as of 18/03/2025 and sounds catchy (or maybe I just needed more coffee ☕).

### 🤖 Why create an AI application?
I wanted a **local**, non-subscription AI tool for:  
- Crafting stories for gaming guilds  
- Personal creative projects  
- Avoiding web-based services with paywalls  

*"If you can't find it... build it!"*

---

### 🧠 Built-in LLM?
**No.** You'll need:  
1. A self-hosted LLM with OpenAI-compatible API support, **OR**  
2. A service like [Featherless](https://featherless.ai)  

*Initial release will use Featherless API with environment variables for keys (documentation coming later).*
